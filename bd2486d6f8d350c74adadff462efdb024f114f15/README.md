## Good Articles

* [DeepLung: Deep 3D Dual Path Nets for Automated Pulmonary Nodule Detection and Classification](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/DeepLung.pdf)
  * Keywords: Dual Path Network (DPN), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), U-Nets
  * Desgin: uses CT scans, has both segmentation and classification stage

## Not-So-Good Articles
* [Identification and classification of brain tumor MRI images with feature extraction using DWT and probabilistic neural network](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/40708_2017_Article_75.pdf)
  * using probabilistic neural network instead of CNN, methods seem old and the accuracy doesn't seem realistic

## Supplement Information
