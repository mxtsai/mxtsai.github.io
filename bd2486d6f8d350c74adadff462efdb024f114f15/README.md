# Sheba Research

## Current Ideas on Mind
 * Maybe apply Gradient Boost for classification stage (similar to DeepLung)?
 * Extend research to include also segmentation (inspired by Deeplung)?
 * How to fix the issue of differerent tumor sizes? 

## Good Papers
### Applied Techniques
* [DeepLung: Deep 3D Dual Path Nets for Automated Pulmonary Nodule Detection and Classification](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Kc2vb4fSFRDJItY3VJELYAlEnUFwqRi)
  * Keywords: Dual Path Network (DPN), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), U-Nets
  * Design: uses CT scans, has both segmentation and classification stage
  
  
* [Multi Modal Convolutional Neural Networks for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1t6cmvZ3wQs3qEuQ-NVLhz05l7WecLxiq)
  * Late convolution fusion layer works better than sum or max fusion
  
* [Fusion of deep learning models of MRI scans, Miniâ€“Mental State Examination, and logical memory test enhances diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Nhzs9Q_c0ObVP78CLpS0aAsSztltekF)
  * Took the 3D MRI and grouped the slices into categories. Then selected 3 slices that are similar between each patient and trained a 2D CNN using transfer learning on each 2D slice.  
  * Incorporated other non-image tests (like BIRADS) and built a SVM using that for prediction.
  * Used majority vote of the the MRI and test's SVM to predict result
  * **Problem:** : Unsure if tumor can be categorized as such, need more information on breast cancer to select such slices 

### Network Architectures
* [Dual Path Networks](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jp28JAsvcatX4g7BSXkHxY1-Yrihszcr)
  * Keywords: ResNet, DenseNet, HORNN (Higher Order RNN)
  * Design: resuses features, and can explore new features

## Not-So-Good Papers
* [Identification and classification of brain tumor MRI images with feature extraction using DWT and probabilistic neural network](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1McJaVlM7YtMVwom4M2ODEPcf9h-46O7A)
  * using probabilistic neural network instead of CNN, methods seem old and the accuracy doesn't seem realistic
