# Sheba Research

## Current Ideas on Mind
 * Maybe apply Gradient Boost for classification stage (similar to DeepLung)?
 * Extend research to include also segmentation (inspired by Deeplung)?
 * How to fix the issue of differerent tumor sizes? 

## Good Papers

* [DeepLung: Deep 3D Dual Path Nets for Automated Pulmonary Nodule Detection and Classification](https://github.com/mxtsai/mxtsai.github.io/blob/master/bd2486d6f8d350c74adadff462efdb024f114f15/papers/DeepLung.pdf)
  * Keywords: Dual Path Network (DPN), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), U-Nets
  * Desgin: uses CT scans, has both segmentation and classification stage

## Not-So-Good Papers
* [Identification and classification of brain tumor MRI images with feature extraction using DWT and probabilistic neural network](https://github.com/mxtsai/mxtsai.github.io/blob/master/bd2486d6f8d350c74adadff462efdb024f114f15/papers/40708_2017_Article_75.pdf)
  * using probabilistic neural network instead of CNN, methods seem old and the accuracy doesn't seem realistic
