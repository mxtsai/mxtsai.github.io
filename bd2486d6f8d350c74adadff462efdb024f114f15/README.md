## Current Ideas on Mind
 * Maybe apply Gradient Boost for classification stage (similar to DeepLung)?
 * Extend research to include also segmentation (inspired by Deeplung)?
 * How to fix the issue of differerent tumor sizes? 

## Good Papers
### Applied Techniques
* [DeepLung: Deep 3D Dual Path Nets for Automated Pulmonary Nodule Detection and Classification](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/DeepLung.pdf)
  * Keywords: Dual Path Network (DPN), Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), U-Nets
  * Design: uses CT scans, has both segmentation and classification stage

### Network Architectures
* [Dual Path Networks](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/1707.01629.pdf)
  * Keywords: ResNet, DenseNet, HORNN (Higher Order RNN)
  * Design: resuses features, and can explore new features

## Not-So-Good Papers
* [Identification and classification of brain tumor MRI images with feature extraction using DWT and probabilistic neural network](https://github.com/mxtsai/Sheba_Research/blob/master/Papers/40708_2017_Article_75.pdf)
  * using probabilistic neural network instead of CNN, methods seem old and the accuracy doesn't seem realistic

## Interesting Papers (not read yet)
* [Wavelet Convolutional Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08620.pdf)
* [Few-shot 3D Multi-modal Medical Image Segmentation using Generative Adversarial Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12241.pdf)
